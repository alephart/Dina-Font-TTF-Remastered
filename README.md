# Dina Font TTF Remastered
This repository contains a hand-modified version of the original 10pt [Dina Bitmap Font,](https://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Jibz/Dina/) converted to TTF format to increase its accessibility. The goal is to have as close to a one-to-one conversion as possible for main-use text.

Other TTF conversions of this font can be found online, but most have severe artifacts as they're not manually adjusted afterwards. For me at least, this makes those converted fonts unusable.

All basic alphanumeric characters have been correctly copied with correct spacing. All commonly used symbols are correctly copied. **Non-english characters are not guaranteed to be copied correctly and may still contain artifacting. No extra characters have been added compared to the original font.**

There is no modified bold font accompanying the modified regular font. This means bolded text will not be the same between the bitmap and TTF-type fonts.

Note that Microsoft's Cleartype system causes a notable visual difference in clarity between bitmap and non-bitmap versions. This has to be adjusted on your end, there's nothing I can do about it. Some text editors and IDEs can directly override the system font smoothing option internally, so you can look into that option if you don't want to modify the entire system's smoothing.

# Installation
Download the DinaRemaster.ttf font and install it to your system in whatever way is needed (real specific, I know!)

**Set your font size to 12 wherever you use this font.** This gives the closest approximation to the original.
